### Changed

- Updated CLI help text to clarify that output option accepts full paths, not just filenames
- Improved output path resolution using absolute paths

### Technical

- Enhanced `saveRegistry` method to handle directory creation automatically
- Added `path.resolve()` and `path.dirname()` for proper path handling
